# OpenMania
This is a WIP open-source framework for making Sonic fangames, heavily based on Sonic Mania. OpenMania features physics accurate to the title, as well as a few objects needed to construct a basic Sonic level. It's also compatible with Mania mods, and can be used to turn mods into independent fangames.
This particular fork is maintained to keep compatibility with the ever-evolving codebase of the Hatch Game Engine.
