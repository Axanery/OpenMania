# OpenMania
This is a WIP open-source framework for making Sonic fangames, heavily based on Sonic Mania. OpenMania features physics accurate to the title, as well as a few objects needed to construct a basic Sonic level. It's also compatible with Mania mods, and can be used to turn mods into independent fangames.

## Disclaimer
This is a non-profit fan project. It is in no way affliated with SEGA or the developers of Sonic Mania. Please buy Sonic Mania with money.

## Basic Usage
This project uses my [Hatch Game Engine](https://github.com/aknetk/HatchGameEngine) to power it. You can either build it from source, or use one of the precompiled binaries on your platform of choice.
(Currently compatible with Windows, MacOS, Nintendo Switch homebrew, Android)

Feel free to use this code in other engines or frameworks, this project is for learning purposes, and I would love for it to be used as such.
